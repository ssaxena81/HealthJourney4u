 * [2024-08-01] COMMENT: This component has been temporarily neutralized.
 * It contained complex logic for a multi-step sign-up process that was not fully implemented
 * and was potentially causing build instability. The application is currently using the simpler
 * `SignUpForm` component for user registration.
 *
 * The original code is preserved in version control and can be restored when this feature is prioritized.
